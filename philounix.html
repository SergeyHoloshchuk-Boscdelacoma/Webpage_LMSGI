		<h1>Unix Shell</h1>
		<h2>and the Libre software philosophy</h2>
		
		 <img src="css/imatges/unix.gif" alt="unix-shell-gif" class="center"> </img>
		
		<p>You need to understand your computer, in this page we will explain:</p> 
		
		<ol>
			<li>the layers of an operative system</li>
			<li>the linux file hierarchy</li>
			<li>what is libre software</li>
		</ol>

		<p>Our <strong>operative system</strong> (OS) is a complex software framework that serves as an intermediary between the computer hardware
		and the user interface (all the programs that we use daily) structured in layers to manage resources efficiently.</p> 
		<p>At the base, the <strong>hardware</strong> layer consists of the physical components of a computer, such as the CPU, memory, and 
		storage devices.</p> 
		<p>Above this, the <strong>kernel</strong> layer operates as the core of the OS, responsible for managing system resources, handling 
		communication between hardware and software, and providing essential services like process management and memory 
		allocation. </p>
		<p>The next layer is the <strong>shell</strong>, which serves as a command-line interface, allowing users to interact with 
		the kernel by entering commands. This layer can also include graphical user interfaces (GUIs) that provide a more 
		intuitive way for users to navigate the system. </p>
		<p>Finally, at the top layer, <strong>user applications</strong> leverage the OS's functionalities to perform 
		specific tasks, from productivity software to web browsers. Together, these layers work harmoniously to enable 
		users to harness the full potential of their computer systems while maintaining efficient resource management and 
		security.</p>
		
		<h2>Linux File Hierarchy</h2>
		<img src="css/imatges/filesystem.png" alt="linux_hierarchy" class="center"> </img>
		
		<p>The <strong>Linux filesystem hierarchy</strong> is a structured layout that organizes files and directories 
		in a tree-like format, beginning with the root directory (/). 
		Each directory serves a distinct purpose, contributing to the system's overall functionality.</p>
		
		<p>You can interact, configure, change, create, destroy... every directory that the system has, you can create
		daemons(program that runs as a background process), shortcuts for commands, compile user interfaces from scratch...</p>
		<p>Anything that you want to do you can do it, even break the entire system by removing the kernel...</p>
		<p>...or maybe replace it with another one.</p>
		
		<p> Here is a summary of the directories in the standard file hierarchy that every GNU/Linux distro comes with:</p>
		<p id="parentesis"> (you can visualise it better by looking at the image above)</p>
		
		<p>The <strong>/bin</strong> directory contains essential command binaries that are required for basic system 
		operations. </p>
		
		<p>The <strong>/sbin</strong> directory houses system binaries used primarily by the system administrator for 
		maintenance tasks. </p>
		
		<p>Configuration files are stored in the <strong>/etc</strong> directory, which manages system and application 
		settings.</p> 
		
		<p>User home directories reside under <strong>/home</strong>, providing individual spaces for user files and personal 
		settings.</strong></p>
		
		<p>The <strong>/lib</strong> and <strong>/lib64</strong> directories contain shared libraries necessary for programs to
		function properly.</p> 
		
		<p>The <strong>/usr</strong> directory holds user-related programs, application binaries, and documentation, 
		further organized into subdirectories like <strong>/usr/bin</strong> for user commands and <strong>/usr/share</strong>
		for architecture-independent data.</p>
		
		<p>Temporary files are managed in the <strong>/tmp</strong> directory, which is typically cleared on reboot.</p> 
		<p>The <strong>/var</strong> directory contains variable data files, including logs and mail spools, which are 
		constantly changing.</p> 
		
		<p>The <strong>/dev</strong> directory is essential for device files, providing interfaces to hardware components.</p> 
		
		<p>Understanding this hierarchy is vital for effective navigation and management of a Linux system, ensuring users 
		can locate and manage files efficiently. You don't really need to memorize the names and the uses for each directory,
		after you get used to move around the command line with [cd] and interact with the files with <strong>[mkdir] [mv] [cp]</strong> and 
		compiling and tinkering with configuration files using <strong>[vim] or [nano]</strong> you will already be familiarized with the filesystem.</p>
